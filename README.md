# Village Bible Church: Plano Campus  |  ProPresenter Files

This repo is used to maintain consistent ProPresenter items between the sanctuary computer and any remote machines where users wish to prepare media for Sunday.

# Not everything, though!

GitHub is not a file storage service, so we're opting not to include any big media on here. Announcements and props files are okay, though.

Also, as the `Configuration/Workspace` file changes basically every time ProPresenter opens, it's not really a good idea to include it. The same goes for playlists and libraries. Somehow, just having the songs *in the playlist* counts as an edit, and since it's all in binary, it's hard to see exactly where / what is changing.

# So what's left?

Basically, all the smaller stuff that's used for aesthetics, like themes, props, timers, etc.
